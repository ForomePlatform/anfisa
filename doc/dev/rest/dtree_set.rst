Description
-----------

The request is the principal one for organizing :doc:`../concepts/dtree_pg` for all :term:`datasets<dataset>`.

If **dtree** argument is set, :term:`decision tree` with this name should be registered on 
the server side as :term:`solution item`. Otherwise the argument **code** must
contain :term:`decision tree code`.

If **instr** argument is set (see details in :doc:`s_dtree_instr`) and instruction 
is of type ``"DTREE"``, request modifies decision tree :term:`solution item`: create, update or 
delete item with given name.

If **instr** argument is set and instruction is of other types (``"INSTR"``, ``"POINT"`` *or* 
``"ATOM"``), the code of decision tree is being modified in request, and returning property 
**code** contains result of modifications. See :doc:`s_dtree_instr` for details.

Returning properties:

    **code**: Decision tree is defined by its code written in a dialect of Python. Returning 
        property **code** contains actual state of it.

    **points**: Decision tree splits into sequence of 
        :term:`decision tree points<decision tree point>`. Each point sontrols one 
        or more lines in Python code, possibly with comment lines. Property **points** contain 
        information on them, see :doc:`s_dtree_point` for details. 
    
    **point-counts**: Another portion of information for points, in form of list of
        :doc:`s_point_count`. Information can be incomplete, since evaluation of counts
        might be heavy procedure. Input argument **tm** controls the timeout in this case.
        To receive from server rest of counts the client needs to start series of delayed 
        request :doc:`dtree_counts` using property **rq-id** as input argument. 
        See details of this mechanism :ref:`here<dtree_points_report>`

    **cond-atoms**: Point of kind ``"If"`` contains one or many 
        :term:`decision tree atomic conditions<decision tree atomic condition>`, or in short
        form "atoms". Atoms are
        active zones in user interface: the user can change atomic condition and it 
        causes modification of decision tree of kind ``"ATOM"``
    
        Atoms are indexed by pair of integers: index of point and index in list of 
        point atoms, so property **cond-atoms** is organized as dictionary with 
        integer keys(indexes of points of type ``"If"``) and values as 
        list of :doc:`s_condition` structures.
    
    **labels**: The property contains all :term:`state labels<decision tree state label>` 
        defined on decision tree, it might be used for rendering purposes.
        
    **error**, **line**, **pos**: in case of errors in code of decision tree, these tree 
        properties refer first error in the code, it might be used in rendering or work with 
        code of decision tree
        
    **eval-status**: property is either ``"ok"`` or evaluation error report

    **dtree-list**: names of all decision trees available for dataset, this properties
        supports work with decision tree as :doc:`solution item<../concepts/sol_pack>`
 
Comments
--------

The request is partial analogue to :doc:`ds_stat`. Both methods are principal for 
support main :ref:`work pages<work_pages>` for two mechanisms of :term:`filtration` in the system.
