Description
-----------

The data structure is used in return values of requests 
:doc:`ds_stat`, :doc:`dtree_stat`, :doc:`statunits` and :doc:`statfunc`.
It represents status report for a :term:`filtering property` applied to 
selected set of variants. In case of :term:`workspace` selection
also applies to :term:`transcripts<transcript>`. 

See discussion on :doc:`../concepts/status_report` for understanding 
general principle and details.

In context of requests :doc:`ds_stat`, :doc:`dtree_stat` status report 
can be incomplete. In this case the property **incomplete** is set
and details of status (**min**/**max**/**count** for numeric properties
and **variants** for enum ones) do not present in structure. 

In complete state details of status are always set. If status reports 
for filtering properties (of numeric or enum type)
is incomplete, use request :doc:`statunits` to get them in complete
state. 

In **detailed** case (:term:`workspace` context) the main items for 
counting are :term:`transcripts<transcript>`, so count values form
pair of values in list, first one is for transcripts, second for :term:`variants<variant>`.
Otherwise only single variant count is provided in lists. 

Property **sub-kind** can have the following values (transcipt-based subkinds
are provided only in :term:`workspace` context):

  ================   ====================
   **kind**           **sub-kind**
  ================   ====================
   ``"numeric"``      ``"int"`` 
   
                      ``"float"``
                      
                      ``"transcript-int"`` 
                      
                      ``"transcript-float"``
  ----------------   --------------------
    ``enum``          ``"status"`` 
                      
                      ``"multi"``

                      ``"transcript-status"`` 
                      
                      ``"transcript-multi"``
  ----------------   --------------------
    ``func``          *type of function*

Variants for enumerated properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Complete status report for enumerated filtering properties contains
counters for all value variants registered in dataset. So in generic
case report contains multiple entries with zero counts. 

On stage of rendering status report it is reasonable to hide entries
with zero counts. Really, there is no need for user to see values that 
do not present in selection. So in "normal" case they are to be hidden.

But: rendering of status report can be done in context of existing 
condition, and that condition might refer variants with zero count
in current selection. In this case zero count variants should be visible
and actual of them should be checked. 

Moreover: some variants referred in condition might not be registered
in this concrete dataset, and the user does not need to care of that fact.
So these variants should be added to list of variants 
*on the client side* (with zero counts).

And yet one problem: some variant lists have uncontrolled size. For example,
it happens with property ``Symbol`` in almost any XL-dataset: indeed, 
tens of thousands known genes can appear in this list! In context of 
workspace, with no more than 9000 variants, this list is not more than some 
thousands, it is comparatively good. But even in this case: the user 
has problems in selection of interested variant in so huge lists. 

It is really heavy problem for the current version of the system. In 
future release there should appear an effective and (probably) complex 
solution of this problem.

Functions support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For functions property status structure is formed in two different contexts:

    - requests :doc:`ds_stat`, :doc:`dtree_stat` just declare
        placement of function between filtering properties, so 
        requests return structure with ``null`` as **variants** 
        and additional properties of function environment
        
    - request :doc:`statfunc` returns property status 
        with non-optional **variants** or **err** in case of error
        in evaluation; 
        
        the client can send multiple requests of such 
        kind in short period of time, so for purposes of request identification
        the property status in this case contains also:
        
        - functional environment: values of all arguments, 
        
        - value **rq_id** (and **no** in context of decision tree)

See :doc:`func_ref` for details and function reference.
