Description
-----------
The request affects only :term:`workspaces<workspace>` and is principal one for rendering and modifications of variant tagging.

Tagging mechanism in the system organized by the following principles

* The user can mark any variant in :term:`workspace` with tags

* Any tag is identified by its name and probably has some value

* Preset list of tags are interpreted as check-box tags, value for such tags is *boolean*, by default *false*
    
      (The client receives this information in returning property **check-tags**)
        
* Special tag has name ``"_note"``. This tag is associated with variant if and only if value of it is nonempty text
    
* Other tags are interpreted as "text" tags, he user can mark variants by this tag of this kind with text value, and text value can be empty
    
* Name of any tag (but ``"_note"``) must start with any letter ("alpha") symbol (any alphabet) and must not contain spaces; in terms of Java Script the criterium is as follows:
    
    ::
        
        /^\S+$/u.test(name) && (name[0].toLowerCase() != name[0].toUpperCase())

* Tags of variant is common between presences of variant in all datasets produced from the same :term:`root dataset`. So the system controls state of tagging values for all variants of root dataset, and traces where and when last modification of this common state was made. Information about this state can be changed outside the client session. The client receives this information in properties:

    .. _tags_state:

    * **tags-state**
        Is some internal indicator value, *int* or *string*; if tag state is changing this indicator changes with it
        
    * **upd-time**, **upd-from**
        Information when and from what workspace the tag state changed
    
    * **op-tags** 
        is just list of all "text" tags available; this information can also change with tag state

    Tag structure modifications are performed by the following scenario: 
    
    - The client receives tags structure for variant in **rec_tags** property
    
    - The client modifies this structure
    
    - The client sends the modified copy as argument **tags** of the request
