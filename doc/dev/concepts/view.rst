Viewing regimes
===============

Since :term:`variants<variant>` have variety of properties the system provides 
full functionality for view and study these properties. In this regime the main control 
structure is list of variants. Usually they are :term:`filtered<filtration>`: variants in 
the list are selected from the whole :term:`dataset` by :term:`filters<filter>`, 
:term:`decision trees<decision tree>` and :term:`zones<zone>`.

The user can select any of variant form the list, and view and study the whole information about 
this variant. See also details :doc:`view_pre`.

On different pages the system provides two variants of viewing regime

    .. _full_viewing_regime:
    
    * Full viewing regime
        
        REST API request: :doc:`../rest/ws_list`

        In context of comparatively small :term:`workspace` user can see all selected variants. 
        Features of workspace functionality, :term:`tagging` and :term:`zone` mechanisms are 
        integrated with this regime.         
        
    .. _auxiliary_viewing_regime:
        
    * Auxiliary viewing regime
    
        REST API request: :doc:`../rest/ds_list`

        In contexts of :term:`XL-dataset` or :term:`decision tree` viewing regime looks simpler - 
        no integration with tagging and zones. But in these contexts there is no guarantee 
        that selection is small enough, so the system makes special preparations to restrict list 
        of visible variants:

        * If list is comparatively small (less than 300 variants), visible list if full one 
            (property **records** is used in request :doc:`../rest/ds_list`)
            
        * If list is comparatively large (more than 50 variants), only 25 randomly selected
            samples are visible (property **samples** is used in request :doc:`../rest/ds_list`)
