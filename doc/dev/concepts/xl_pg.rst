XL-dataset work page
====================

:term:`XL-dataset` page is essentially simpler than :doc:`ws_pg`, and contains only subset 
of ws-functionality. But in context of :term:`XL-dataset` evaluations might be heavy,
so the main focus of the Front End application support for this page is an issue of 
heavy evaluations and long delays. 
The page supports the following functionality issues:
    
    - Full complex of :doc:`filters_reg` with its features:

        - :doc:`status_report`
        
        - support :term:`filters<filter>` as :doc:`sol_work`

        - the logic of regime requires top detailization of information, so  
            :term:`transcripts<transcript>` are used as :term:`filtration` items 
            instead of :term:`variants<variant>`
    
    - :ref:`Auxiliary viewing regime<auxiliary_viewing_regime>` as the main regime    
    
    - operation support:
        
        - creation of :term:`secondary workspace`
        
        - :term:`Export` operation: form and provide access to download Excel document 
            with properties of filtered variants, in case if count of variants is limited 
            (up to 300 variants).
