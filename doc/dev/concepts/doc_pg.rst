Documentation work page
=======================

Documentation page for :term:`dataset` provides access to documents associated with the dataset. If dataset was created as :term:`secondary one<secondary workspace>` the page also provides access to documentation of all ancestors of the dataset.

Documents associated with dataset might be formed by two ways:

    * Either they are preformatted documents (in various formats) provided in original dataset complication,
        
    * Or it is a report formed inside the system on stage of loading or creation of dataset with name "Info. In case of creation dataset as :term:`secondary one<secondary workspace>` report includes representation of :term:`filtration` process used for filtering items in dataset

All documents are available in system with URL of the form:

    ``<URL to application back end>/dsdoc/<ds name>/<path to document>``

The system provides access to two CSS files from HTML pages of documentation: ``report.css`` and ``py_pygments.css``. This internal feature allows to control styling for HTML documentation. 

See :ref:`configuration settings<docs_cfg>` to configure access to these files properly.

(The second styling file ``py_pygments.css`` is necessary to render :term:``decision tree code`` that might be used in secondary workspace creation).
