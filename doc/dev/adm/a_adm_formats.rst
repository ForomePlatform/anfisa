Configuration of the service
****************************

The main control file of the service is :doc:`anfisa.json<configuration>`.


Primary dataset information
***************************

Any :term:`primary dataset` is set up based on data prepared in preliminary 
:term:`annotation pipeline` process. So annotation pipeline is the necessary part
of the whole Anfisa project but it's proper description is not a part of this 
documentation: Anfisa service uses only results of this pipeline, in form of 
:term:`annotated json files`, usually in the following formats: 
``*.json``, ``*.json.gz``, ``*.json.bz2``

    * The most simple and primitive way of dataset creation uses 
        only this file: just run :doc:`storage` with **--source** option 
        (**--config** option is required, and **--kind** option is important 
        in case of XL-dataset)
        
    * More extended way of dataset creation uses :doc:`a_inventory`: run
        :doc:`storage` with **--inv** option (**--config** and **--key** 
        options play the same role as above)
        
    * Both ways above operate single dataset, but there is some integration 
        solution. The system administrator can create a file :doc:`a_storage_dir`, 
        collect there all information on primary datasets being maintained, 
        and use path to this file as **--dir** option. 
        
        In this context options **--config**, **--source**, **--inv**, **--kind** 
        are out of sense because all correspondent peaces of information are 
        being retrieved from :doc:`a_storage_dir`.
