Predefined filters
*******************

This section contains a description of all pre-defined filter sets and decision trees.

Filters
=======
The following simple filters are built-in:

* Candidate variants for autosomal dominant inheritance
* Candidate variants for homozygous recessive inheritance
* Candidate variants for compound heterozygous recessive inheritance
* Candidate variants for X-linked inheritance
* Variants, possibly affecting splicing
* Variants with in-silico damaging predictions


Decision trees
==============
The following inclusion and exclusion criteria are built-in in AnFiSA as Decision Trees:

* An American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) list of 73 genes, in which mutations are known to be pathogenic.
* Rare variants for a trio
* Variants for analysis of undiagnosed diseases
* Variants with damaging predictions
* Possible hearing loss pathogenic variants

The details are provided in the supplementary materials of the AnFiSA paper //TODO:link.
